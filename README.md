A mobile & web application that can be downloaded on low-cost phones for a “rickshaw-on-call service”, 
converting the idle time of rickshaw pullers
to productive time and making cycle rickshaws available at the door step. 
You could refer to other apps in the market like Uber, but build it to minimize 
device interaction and time spent on the app as most of these rickshaw-pullers aren’t educated.
